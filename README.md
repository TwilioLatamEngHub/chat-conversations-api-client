## Configuring and getting started

You will need a backend service for this app to work.

[Click here to check the backend repo for this app which is using Twilio Serverless Functions](https://github.com/TwilioLatamEngHub/chat-conversations-api-serverless).

There you can find more details on how to set it up correctly.

After setting up the backend, you just need to clone this repo, `npm install` and `npm start` to run it.
